# ⚔️ **Legends of Conquest — Game Manual**

**Legends of Conquest** is a fast-paced, turn-based tactical strategy game. You play as the commander of an alliance force, facing off against a powerful Imperial AI to seize control of the River Valley battlefield.

---

## 🌟 Core Features

### 🏰 Four-City Domination

Forget slow “eliminate-all-units” gameplay. Your real objective is to capture the **four enemy cities** scattered across the map.
Any unit stepping onto an enemy city **instantly captures** it. Balancing attack and defense is the key to victory.

### 🌊 Terrain Matters

Terrain is not visual decoration — it decides the outcome.

* **Water (⚡)**: Movement speed *doubles*. Use the river network to launch blitz attacks and flank the enemy.
* **Mountains (🛡️)**: Impassable walls with **2× defense** for defenders. A single squad on a mountain chokepoint can hold back an entire army.

### ⚔️ Deep Tactical Play

* **Mass-Recruit System**: Every turn, each of your unoccupied cities automatically produces fresh troops. Protecting your cities means protecting your lifeline.
* **Unit Merging**: Combine scattered units to form a single squad of up to **5 soldiers**, creating unstoppable strike teams for key battles.

---

## 🏆 1. Victory Conditions

**“He who takes the cities wins.”**

There are **eight cities** on the battlefield (4 yours, 4 enemy).

* **Win**: Capture all **4 enemy cities**.
* **Lose**: All **4 of your cities** are captured.

Capturing is immediate — the moment your unit stands on the enemy city tile, that city becomes yours.

---

## ♟️ 2. Units & Recruitment

### 1. Recruitment System (“Mass Production”)

At the **start of every turn**, the game checks all cities under your control.

Production rule:
If a city tile is **empty** (no friendly or enemy unit), the system automatically spawns a **free new unit** there.

**Strategy:**
Do NOT leave your units sitting on your own cities unless necessary. Move them away so the city can produce more troops next turn.

---

### 2. Unit Attributes

* **Strength (middle number)**: Represents number of soldiers / combat power. Starts at 1.
* **Speed (visible when selected)**: Maximum movement range per turn. Starts at 5.

#### Merging Units

Move one friendly unit onto another to merge them.

* **Max Strength**: 5 soldiers per unit.
* **Cost**: The merged unit becomes slower — its new speed is **(the slower unit’s speed – 1)**.

---

## 🗺️ 3. Terrain Rules (Core Mechanics)

Terrain is the heart of the game’s strategy. Mastering it is essential.

### 🌲 Plains (Green)

* No special effects
* Normal movement (1 tile = 1 step)

### 🌊 Water (Blue – Rivers/Sea)

* **Speed doubled**: moving 1 tile costs only **0.5 movement points**.
* **Land → Water (Entering water)**: Remaining movement is forced to 0; turn ends immediately.
* **Water → Land (Landing)**: Must move adjacent to land first; after landing, turn ends.

**Use water for long-range flanking, but plan for the mandatory entry/exit turns.**

### ⛰️ Mountains (Brown)

* **2× defense** for defenders (effective strength doubled)
* **Cannot move directly from mountain to mountain**
* Must climb from plains or descend to plains
* **Descending** ends movement for the turn

---

## ⚔️ 4. Combat Rules

### 1. Kill Condition

Combat uses strict “greater-than” rules:

A unit can only attack if:
**Attacker strength > Defender strength**

Examples:

* 3 vs 2 → attacker wins
* 3 vs 3 → attack not allowed

### 2. Terrain Modifiers

If defender is on a mountain:

**Attack requirement:**
Attacker strength > (Defender strength × 2)

Example:
Defender has 2 on mountain ⇒ effective strength = 4
You need **5** to defeat it.

## 🧠 5. Tactical Advice

### **1. Clear Your Production Tiles**

At the start of every turn, check your cities.
If your own unit is standing there, move it away unless it’s already full strength. Every empty city tile means **one more free troop next turn**.

### **2. Hold Chokepoints**

Use mountain tiles to block critical paths.
A 3-man squad on a mountain often requires a 5-man elite enemy unit to dislodge.

### **3. Exploit River Speed**

Rivers are your highways. Use them to redeploy troops rapidly or to strike enemy cities from behind. But remember: landing ends your turn — plan carefully.

### **4. Merge Only When Necessary**

A single 5-man squad is strong but slow and occupies one tile.
Five separate 1-man squads can capture more territory and perform multi-directional threats.
Only merge when preparing for **decisive assaults** (e.g., enemy stronghold or mountain defense).

**Good luck, Commander. May your banner rise over the River Valley.**
